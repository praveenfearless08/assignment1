Static Website - It is prebuilt source code returned by server created by simple langaugae HTML, CSS and JavaScript .
Web pages are returned by the server with no change therefore, static Websites are fast.
There is no interaction with databases. 
Also, they are less costly as the host does not need to support server-side processing with different languages.

Dynamic Website - WebPage are return by server which are processed during runtime it means they are not prebuilt but they are build when user demand 
during runtime by help of some scripting languages like PHP, .net, Node, ASP etc.
So, they are slower than static websites but updates and interaction with databases are possible.
